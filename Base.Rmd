# Introduction and context

## Basic information

**Title**: Do Reputable Open Access Journals Require Open Data Sharing?  
**Summary**: This study analyzes the submission requirements of the most reputable open access journals to determine the extent to which they require data sharing as a condition of publication.  
**Funding**: This research is being submitted to the J. Bohannon Foundation  
**Duration**: This one year project will be administered between `r as.Date("2018-09-01")` and `r as.Date("2018-09-01")+364`  

## What are the aims and purpose of research?

According to the Research Data Alliance [Data Policy Standardisation and Implementation group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation):

>"the prevalence of research data policies from institutions and research funders is increasing, so publishers and editors are paying more attention to  standardisation and the wider adoption of data sharing policies."

This study investigates whether the most reputable Open Access journals require authors to openly share the data underlying the published article. We build on the work of [Castro et al, 2017] who studied randomly-selected open access journals to determine if they had data sharing policies. Their findings reveal that a small minority of open access journals require data and software associated with an article be made openly available. 

In this proposed study, We will adapt the Castro et al. study design to investigate only the most repubutable open access journals. Specifically, we will analyze  journals that have attained the Seal of Approval from the [_**Directory of Open Access Journals, DOAJ**_](http://doaj.org). The _**DOAJ Seal**_ currently recognizes **`r nrow(doaj_seal)` journals**. These open access journals are considered the most reputable because they: 

>"achieve a high level of openness, adhere to Best Practice and high publishing standards.The Seal is awarded to a journal that fulfills a set of criteria related to accessibility, openness, discoverability, reuse and author rights. It acts as a signal to readers and authors that the journal has generous use and reuse terms, author rights and adheres to the highest level of 'openness'. " ^[Footnote about DOAJ selection for Seal Approval goes here]

To view a sample of this dataset, let's look at the first few rows in a table.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(doaj_seal), 
             caption = "Initial 6 rows of DOAJ Dataset")
```

## What are the aims and purpose of the Data Management Plan (DMP) ? Who is the target audience?

- Research Project participants
    + The DMP will guide the capture, handling, and storage of all project data and and other outputs during and after the active phase of the project.     
    + It is an essential reference for all investigators involved in the project.
- Curators and Preservationists 
    + Library personnel responsible for the curation and long term preservation of project outputs after the active phase of the project will consult the DMP to understand standards to follow
- The Funding Agency 
    + The funders supporting this research will evaluate the DMP as an essential step in proposal review.  
    + Should funding be awarded, the Agency will consult the DMP to determine what outputs to expect and monitor project progress

- Open Access: BOAI definition as a quote, cite BOAI
- Data sharing policies 


# Legal, rights and ethical issues

- The data provided by the Directory of Open Access Journals is distributed under a 

re-used in this project is distributed under a xxx license allowing xyz, per the Legal Interop Guidelines 
- Full attribution to reused third party data will be provided in all outputs per the Data Citation Principles of RDA
- The Institutional Copyright Policy of the investigator's employer specifies that data and other deliverables from this project belong to the institution but may be distributed in an open access repository under a CC license with copyright retained by the Institution 
- the funder requires that dissemination of all outputs be made under a CC-BY license allowing generous access, modification and reuse

# Data collection and standards

The  technical  infrastructure  for  the  project  will  make  use  of  free  and  /  or  open  source 
software  where  possible.

In order to ensure the widest possible use, the invstigators aim to disseminate the data, code, and textual narrative in plain text formats (Markdown files, R Scripts) to ensure wide reuse by humans and machines; cross-platform compatibility and portability; and fitness for preservation over time.

 R is a xxxxxx

The metadata prepared for xxxx

No exceptional metadata/cataloguing difficulty is expected during the project. Analyzed datasets will be documented using the DataCite metadata schema and carefully version-controlled using Git and GitHub.

# Short-term storage and data management

During the active phase of the project, data will be stored on and backed up to the Research Data Storage Facility (RDSF) at Trieste Polytechnic Institute.
The facility represents 2 million pounds of digital resilient storage, with ongoing capital investment. The RDSF 
is overseen by a steering group of senior research and
support staff, which includes the PVC Research. 
Backup procedures are robust (overnight backup, copies held remotely on 
tape) and secured access is in 
place

# Deposit and long-term preservation

After the project conclusion, all research outputs will be made openly availalbe under a cc license in GitHub and in the xxx Repository. In addition to serving as a data storage facility for the duration of the project, ACRC will undertake to preserve each of the digital outputs mentioned above, 
for three years beyond the end of the project
on the Research Data Storage Facility, undertaking 
refreshment of storage media as required
.
These materials will be available on request. Sustainability and open access are discussed below
